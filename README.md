svn-stash
==========

It's like the git stash command, but for Subversion. If you don't know git, you should be [this guide.]()
Svn-stash permits you to hide the changes that you don't want to commit just now. this can be more useful in some circunstances.

Why?
----------

I love git and I think that it should be used in the new projects that WHATEVER programmer will start (If you don't think the same,   You are welcome to discuss it with me, but you can read [the pro git book](http://git-scm.com/book) before. :) )
